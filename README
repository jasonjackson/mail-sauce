A distributed email newsletter system which utilizes:

Resque - http://wiki.github.com/defunkt/resque/

Tenjin - http://www.kuwata-lab.com/tenjin/

Redis - http://code.google.com/p/redis/

TMail - http://tmail.rubyforge.org/

Usage:


Start some workers.  See the Resque documentation for more info.

jjackson@sfqload01 /mail-sauce/services/emailer/actors
$ COUNT=8 QUEUE=priority,normal rake resque:workers


Start Redis.  This depends on if you installed via gems or RPM.

jjackson@sfqload01 /
$ redis-server


Send an email list:

jjackson@sfqload01  /mail-sauce/services/emailer/mappers
$ ./send.rb -t -l my_email_list_name


Start resque-web to get your pretty web interface:

jjackson@sfqload01  /mail-sauce/services/emailer/mappers
$ resque-web
[Mon Mar 29 11:26:51 +0000 2010] Starting 'resque-web'...
[Mon Mar 29 11:26:51 +0000 2010] trying port 5678...



It's still a bit of a work in progress and can use a little refactoring and cleaning.  
So far it feels very stable, and is looking good for a production release.  If you have 
any questions, need help setting it up, or know how it can be better please do hit me up 
at:

http://dotrb.com and ping Jason Jackson (me)  or the site admin (me).
